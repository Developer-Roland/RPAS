 Roland's  PSOBB   AutoHotKey Script
 ```

RPAS is an AutoHotKey (AHK) script designed to improve ergonomics for KB players & to add numerous utility features for PSOBB.

RPAS allows the player to effortlessly access all combat-related controls with their right hand, without lifting the left hand from WASD. This allows the player to retain control over movement at all times during battle. The vanilla controls, on the other hand, require finger gymnastics to do the same, with the right hand often dancing around the left hand and either hand requiring finger stretches to reach out-of-the-way keys such as the function keys. No such finger stretching or dancing is required with RPAS!

## Features
1. Ergonomic KB Controls
2. User Friendly with Ingame Infographics
3. Rapid-Fire Enter/Action Keys
4. UAC Mitigation
    * *Without globally disabling UAC prompts - for maximum security - RPAS allows you to launch PSO or the Floor Reader w/o UAC prompt(s), meaning you never need to crash PSO again (since UAC prompts crash PSO)*
5. Clipboard Paste
6. Open Source: You can view the source code on GitHub, through ResourceHacker, and in your RPAS user folder
    * *See the [View Source Code in ResourceHacker](#view-source-code-in-resourceHacker) section for instructions*
    * *The RPAS user folder can be found at ```C:\Users\[UserName]\RPAS-RolandsPsobbAhkScript```*
   
## Installation
1. Move the ```RPAS-RolandsPsobbAhkScript.exe``` to your PSOBB folder
	- Get this from the latest release at https://github.com/Developer-Roland/RPAS/releases
	- The script will auto-close if opened from any other folder, so this detail is mandatory.
	
## How to Use
1. Launch ```RPAS-RolandsPsobbAhkScript.exe```
2. Ensure your ```Numlock``` is enabled while using this AHK script!
3. The script's keybinds only operate when a PSOBB application is focused!
